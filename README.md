Companion app for [MaNbot](https://github.com/DamnStraight/MaNbot) to serve markov chain and tensorflow generated messages based on models trained using user chat logs.

Unless you can scrape A LOT of meaningful messages from a user, the user generated messages will be a lot more coherent using markov chains.

Made using:
- Flask
- Markovify
- tensorflow
